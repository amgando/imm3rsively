imm3rsively is the word people use when they suspect the future of education has already arrived.  

we've been teaching adults for many years and see a clear path to better learning.

here are a few key ingredients that reliably lead to effective, equitable adult education.

1) meaningful inner work

  - psychological safety
  - diverse mental models
  - facilitated self-discovery

2) directed deliberate practice

  - challenging project-based work
  - expert facilitation
  - expert instruction

3) a capable community

  - motivated peers
  - access to alumni
  - access to professionals

4) focus

  - uninterrupted time
  - facilitated reflection
  - space designed for engagement
